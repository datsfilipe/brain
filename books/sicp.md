## Dediction x Foreword

- Having fun is important
- Programming is about practice
- Programmers should seek perfection
- Smaller programs evolve to bigger programs
- The same rules for smaller programs does not directly apply for bigger programs
- As we write bigger programs, we tend to optmize code to make it smaller and to fit the program
- "In any event, hardware always operates at a level more primitive than that at which we care to program."
- Talks about Lisp programming language, it's simplicity of syntax and it's use on AI field

## Preface 1st and 2nd Editions

- "Mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of “what is.” Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of “how to.”"

## Elements of a programming language

- Primitive expressions: Represent the simplest entities the language is concerned with
- Means of combination: By which compound elements are built from simpler ones
- Means of abstraction: By which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units

In programming we deal with two kinds of elements: procedures and data (we'll se they're not so distinct). Informally:

- Data is stuff we want to manipulate
- Procedures are descriptions of the rules for manipulating that stuff
