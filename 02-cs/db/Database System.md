# Database System

## History

- IBM with the invention of the Hard Disk, and previously, the Von Neumann architecture, initiated the age of the data processing.
- The databases were an natural evolution from file systems.
- The duty to manage the data was given to intermediary software, called Database Management Systems (DBMS), istead of the applications programs.

### Relational Model

- Invention by Edgar Codd, 1970.
- The data structure is a math function denominated **relation**.
- SQL was the language created by IBM to manipulate the data in the relational model.
- LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) is a stack of technologies that was very popular in the 2000s.
    - MySQL is a DBMS, by Oracle, that implements the relational model.
- The Ingres project, from the University of California, Berkeley, has originated some cool things:
    - Sybase, which was later associated with Microsoft to create SQL Server.
    - Postgres (from Post Ingres), which extends the model with POO concepts.
